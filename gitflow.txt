develop & master branch

DELETE feature branches (local & remote):
git push origin --delete <branch>
git branch -d <branch>

SQUASHing:
- git pull on develop
- git pull on feature-branch
- sync if needed via rebase/merge, if not conflicts in PR it's fine
- from feature-branch: 
git rebase --interactive HEAD~4 (total number of commits is 4 here)
- reword first, squash rest :wq (or pick if no need to reword)
- second screen: reword it :wq
- third screen (comes up if reworded rather than picked) should show reworded commit first and other picked commits, just :wq
- git push origin feature-branch --force

CHERRY PICK from develop -> master:
git pull on develop
git pull on master
on master: git cherry-pick <some-develop-commit-hash>
